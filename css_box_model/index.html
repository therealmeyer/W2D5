by the way... absolute is a position property value, not a display property value – me_ Jan 17 at 21:11
ok , well the value flex to the display property will allow you arrang items inside the div invoked on. IT will help you to keep all the items for an example to the left or to the right or even spread them with equal spaces between then , horizontally or vertically. Obviously if the divs are position fixed or sticky or absolute this will not work with flex.
